To compile the program, type 'make' in this directory.  For more
information on usage, background etc. refer to the copious comments at
the top of export_locals.c

Files in this directory and their purpose in life:

export_locals.c - the main C source file.
example.c       - a sample program that uses libbfd to create a new
                  ELF object file with a symbols table containing a
		  global symbol.
data/           - some misc. files I have used to test the
                  functionality.

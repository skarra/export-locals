Please read the comments at the top of the main sourcefile
export_locals.c

Files in this directory and their purpose in life:

export_locals.c - the main C source file.
example.c       - a sample program that uses libbfd to create a new
                  ELF object file with a symbols table containing a
		  global symbol.
data/           - some misc. files I have used to test the
                  functionality.
